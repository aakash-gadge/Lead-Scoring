# Lead-Scoring-
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

This case study was part of my course curriculum and the data used and attached was made available by upGrad.
